# Solr Sunspot Production Example

This is a companion repository to the article on how to take Solr 5 and a rails app with search provided by [sunspot](https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot) to production. We use vagrant to spin up a virtual machine, ansible and [cameos](http://github.com/idxp/cameos) to provision the machine, and a custom task to bootstrap the application.
